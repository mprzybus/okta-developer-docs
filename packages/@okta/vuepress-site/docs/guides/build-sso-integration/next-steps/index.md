You should now understand how to build a app integration that uses single sign-on (SSO) for authentication.

If you have any problems with your integration, contact <developers@okta.com>, or post a question in our [Developer Forum](https://devforum.okta.com).

After you have completed your testing and your app is working as expected, you can start the submission process to have your app included in the [Okta Integration Network](https://www.okta.com/okta-integration-network/) (OIN).

Our [OIN Submit an app integration guide](/docs/guides/submit-app) takes you through the steps required to submit your SSO integration through the OIN Manager site.
