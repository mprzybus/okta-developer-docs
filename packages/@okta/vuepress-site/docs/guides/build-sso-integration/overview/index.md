As an app developer, you want to give your users the ability to sign in directly to your Okta integration. Your application needs to support federated Single Sign-On. In this scenario, your application relies on Okta to serve as an external Identity Provider.

Okta supports two protocols for handling federated Single Sign-On:

* [OpenID Connect (OIDC)](/docs/concepts/auth-overview/#openid-connect)
* [Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML)](/docs/concepts/saml/)

Your choice of protocol depends mainly on your use case, but OIDC is generally recommended for new integrations.

## OIDC

* Provides an identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0 protocol.
* Verifies end-user identity and obtains profile information.
* Newer protocol with widespread usage.
* Lightweight and REST-based.
* Ideal for mobile and cloud applications.
* Can be combined with [OAuth 2.0](https://oauth.net/2/) protocol for use cases like machine-to-machine or device authentication.
* Some newer applications only support Single Sign-On using OIDC. However, there is usually a workaround for federating through a remote identity provider using SAML and OIDC.
* User consent is an available feature of the underlying OAuth 2.0 layer. OIDC can request permission to share user profile details, so it satisfies many privacy regulations like GDPR.

## SAML

* Widely used federation protocol for SSO in Web applications.
* Many SaaS providers support SAML integration to give SSO access to end users.
* The SAML specification doesnâ€™t have user consent flow, although it can be built into the flow.
* SAML is larger in size because XML messages are transmitted back and forth.
